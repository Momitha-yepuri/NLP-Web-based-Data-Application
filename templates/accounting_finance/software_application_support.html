              <b> Job Description: </b>  Working for a market leading software house. You will provide functional support to customers on how to use the software and deal with bugs as well. 
              You MUST have an excellent telephone manner, top drawer customer service skills and proven ability to learn complex business software and turn technical jargon 
              into normal language. Some support is by email so you must also have a decent level of written English. 
              
              <br> <br> Full training on their software will be given but any 
              experience of a complex ERP, CRM or Accounts package would be advantageous as would experience of finance terms and SQL based databases. Due to location it is 
              nearly essential that you have your own transport (ample free parking) hours of work are usually **** (traffic avoidance times). Excellent company who value 
              their staff and keep them, this is an entry level role although it will NOT lead to an IS support role (in the short term) it is very much functional support.
